### Project Structure

- Large screens (above 1200px)

- Tablets and medium devices (between 768px and 1024px)

- Smartphones (below 768px)

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for small screens */
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  /* Styles for tablets */
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 1025px) {
  /* Styles for large screens */
}
```
